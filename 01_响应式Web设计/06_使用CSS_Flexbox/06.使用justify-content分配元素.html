<!-- CSS justify-content 属性定义了浏览器之间，如何分配顺着弹性容器主轴(或者网格行轴) 的元素之间及其周围的空间。 -->

<!-- Flex有一个称之为主轴的概念，贯穿所有元素。你可以选择配置主轴贯穿的位置，
从而调整元素在布局内的摆放。比如，你实用 justify-content:center 就告诉所有子元素都以容器的中心摆放，
它还有以下几种选项：

    flex-start: 
        aligns items to the start of the flex container. 
        For a row, this pushes the items to the left of the container. 
        For a column, this pushes the items to the top of the container. 
        This is the default alignment if no justify-content is specified.

    flex-end: 
        aligns items to the end of the flex container. 
        For a row, this pushes the items to the right of the container. 
        For a column, this pushes the items to the bottom of the container.

    space-between: 
        aligns items to the center of the main axis, with extra space placed between the items. 
        The first and last items are pushed to the very edge of the flex container. 
        For example, in a row the first item is against the left side of the container, 
        the last item is against the right side of the container, 
        then the remaining space is distributed evenly among the other items.

    space-around: 
        similar to space-between but the first and last items are not locked to the edges of the container, 
        the space is distributed around all the items with a half space on either end of the flex container.

    space-evenly: 
        Distributes space evenly between the flex items with a full space at either end of the flex container

<!-- TODO: An example helps show this property in action. 
    Add the CSS property justify-content to the #box-container element, and give it a value of center.
    Bonus
        Try the other options for the justify-content property in the code editor to see their differences. 
        But note that a value of center is the only one that will pass this challenge. -->
