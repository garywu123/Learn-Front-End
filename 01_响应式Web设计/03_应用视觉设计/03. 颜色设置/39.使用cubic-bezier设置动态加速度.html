  <!-- 解释 cubic-bezier(0,0,0.58,1)
    https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/CSS/Tools/Cubic_Bezier_Generator

    Remember that all cubic-bezier functions start with p0 at (0, 0) and end with p3 at (1, 1). 
    In this example, the curve moves faster through the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to p1 y value of 0, then goes to p2 y value of 1) than it moves through the X-axis (0 to start, then 0 for p1, up to 0.58 for p2). As a result, the change in the animated element progresses faster than the time of the animation for that segment. Towards the end of the curve, the relationship between the change in x and y values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1 (no change), and the x values move from 0.58 to 1, making the animation changes progress slower compared to the animation duration.
