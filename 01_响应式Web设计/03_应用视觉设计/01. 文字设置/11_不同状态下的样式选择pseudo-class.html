<!--This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes.
A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors,
in order to select a specific state of the element.

For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed
for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector.
Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:-->
<style>
    a {
        color: #000;
    }
    a:hover {
        color: blue;
    }

</style>
